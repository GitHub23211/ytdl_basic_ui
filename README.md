## Basic UI for [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) built using Tkinter

* Error-checks for valid YouTube URLs.
* Uses a queue to download multiple songs at once if needed.
* Converts download into a .mp3 format and saves to a chosen directory.
* Cleans up .part files from incomplete downloads.
* Compiled together with  [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) (with minor changes) to integrate the library with the UI application.
